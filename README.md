This project was made for educational purposes, we were learning the lanagages while creating the website. It may explain some part of the website that are note fully optimized.


// THE INITIAL PROJECT //

The goal was to create a website presenting some of our projects at first. We only used the Materialize framework with a bit of CSS and JS.

Then we had to made the project fully editable from an admin panel. It means that we had to deconstruct half of the html code to had some PHP in it and stock all of our texts,
images and more in a data base using Wamp and PHPMyAdmin & MySQL. 

The webesite might be updated in the future, the medifications will be written in the ReadMe if so.
